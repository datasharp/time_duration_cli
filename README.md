# Time Duration Calculator CLI Tool

## Next Steps:

##### Add AM and PM functionality

Example:
python time_duration.py 8:30 AM 10:22 PM

##### Make AM and PM not case sensitive

Example:
python time_duration.py 8:30 am 10:22 pm

##### Default to PM when time is not specifically stated

Example:
python time_duration.py 8:30 10:22

##### Add option to have CLI tool run from start to end and output time at end

Example:

python time_duration.py *start

...

python time_duration.py *end


Output: Duration between start and end times
